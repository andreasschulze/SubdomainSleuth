// This check is designed to identify dangling CNAMEs.  A dangling CNAME is
// defined as a CNAME that points to something that doesn't exist.  Since
// CNAMEs may be chained, this break may occur at any point in that chain.
//
// To check, we perform several recursive lookups on the target of the CNAME.
// We currently check for A, AAAA, and TXT records.  If any of these types
// exist in the answer, we consider the CNAME to be valid.  If not, it is
// considered to be dangling.
//
// We could use a single ANY query instead of separate queries for A, AAA, and
// TXT, but I've found that this isn't reliable in the wild.  Different servers
// may not give complete answers for an ANY query.  As such, we do separate
// lookups.

// These are the type of targets that we try to resolve for CNAMEs to see if
// they're valid.  If we don't find one of these, we consider the CNAME to be
// dangling.
