// that aren't reachable, and name servers that won't answer for the zone that
// is delegated to them.

// query for the zone being delegated directly to the server.  This is done
// for both IPv4 and IPv6 if they're available.  Failure to resolve the target
// name server is an error.  It is also an error if our SOA query doesn't
// result in an SOA for the name being delegated.
